You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love. - Martin Luther King Jr.': 1.1210329644027588, 'It is necessary for the welfare of society that genius should be privileged to utter sedition, to blaspheme, to outrage good taste, to corrupt the youthful mind, and generally to scandalize one`s uncles. - George Bernard Shaw': 0.8157333499005741, 'Everything that used to be a sin is now a disease. - Bill Maher': 3.3933584753025405, 'It is always thus, impelled by a state of mind which is destined not to last, that we make our irrevocable decisions. - Marcel Proust': 2.0393333747514353, 'What a man`s mind can create, man`s character can control. - Thomas Edison': 2.0393333747514353, 'The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature. - Abraham Lincoln': 1.1210329644027588, 'It is your mind that creates this world. - Siddhartha Buddha': 4.078666749502871, 'The heart has its reasons, of which the mind knows nothing. - Blaise Pascal': 4.281399303556952, 'Beauty is ever to the lonely mind a shadow fleeting; she is never plain. She is a visitor who leaves behind the gift of grief, the souvenir of pain. - Christopher Morley': 1.3595555831676234, 'We all wish to be judged by our peers, by the men `after our own heart.` Only they really know our mind and only they judge it by standards we fully acknowledge. Theirs is the praise we really covet and the blame we really dread. The little pockets of early Chrstians survived because they cared exclusively for the love of `the bretheren` and stopped their ears to the opinion of the Pagan society around them. But a circle of criminals, cranks, or perverts survives in just the same way; by becoming deaf to the opinion of the outer world, by discounting it as the chatter of outsiders who `don`t understand,` of the `conventional,` the `bourgeois,` the `Establishment,` of prigs, prudes, and humbugs. - C.S. Lewis': 0.5708532404742603, 'A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. - Oliver Wendell Holmes': 2.0393333747514353, 'Games lubricate the body and the mind. - Benjamin Franklin': 2.0393333747514353}\n"
