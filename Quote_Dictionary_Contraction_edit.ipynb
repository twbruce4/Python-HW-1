      "{'As every divided kingdom falls, so every mind divided between many studies confounds and saps itself. - Leonardo da Vinci': 2.0393333747514353, 'No passion so effectually robs the mind of all its powers of acting and reasoning as fear. - Edmund Burke': 2.0393333747514353, 'In every man`s heart there is a secret nerve that answers to the vibrations of beauty. - Christopher Morley': 4.484131857611035, 'The mind of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a bric-\\xe0-brac shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above its proper value. - Oscar Wilde': 2.0393333747514353, 'What we are today comes from our thoughts of yesterday and our present thoughts build our life tomorrow. Our life is the creation of our mind. - Siddhartha Buddha': 0.8157333499005741, 'Too many poets delude themselves by thinking that the mind is dangerous and must be left out. Well, the mind is dangerous and must be left in. - Robert Frost': 4.078666749502871, 'Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable. - C.S. Lewis': 0.640590265373005, 'I will honor Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. - Charles Dickens': 4.484131857611035, 'The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart. - Helen Keller': 1.4947106192036783, 'My mind is my own church. - Thomas Paine': 2.0393333747514353, '`Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but he whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves his conduct, will pursue his principles unto death. - Thomas Paine': 2.2420659288055176, 'Show me your hands. Do they have scars from giving? Show me your feet. Are they wounded in service? Show me your heart. Have you left a place for divine love? - Fulton J. Sheen': 1.4947106192036783, 'Everybody can be great... because anybody can serve. You don`t have to have a college degree to serve. You don`t have to make your subject and verb agree to serve. You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love. - Martin Luther King Jr.': 1.1210329644027588, 'It is necessary for the welfare of society that genius should be privileged to utter sedition, to blaspheme, to outrage good taste, to corrupt the youthful mind, and generally to scandalize one`s uncles. - George Bernard Shaw': 0.8157333499005741, 'Everything that used to be a sin is now a disease. - Bill Maher': 3.3933584753025405, 'It is always thus, impelled by a state of mind which is destined not to last, that we make our irrevocable decisions. - Marcel Proust': 2.0393333747514353, 'What a man`s mind can create, man`s character can control. - Thomas Edison': 2.0393333747514353, 'The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature. - Abraham Lincoln': 1.1210329644027588, 'It is your mind that creates this world. - Siddhartha Buddha': 4.078666749502871, 'The heart has its reasons, of which the mind knows nothing. - Blaise Pascal': 4.281399303556952, 'Beauty is ever to the lonely mind a shadow fleeting; she is never plain. She is a visitor who leaves behind the gift of grief, the souvenir of pain. - Christopher Morley': 1.3595555831676234, 'We all wish to be judged by our peers, by the men `after our own heart.` Only they really know our mind and only they judge it by standards we fully acknowledge. Theirs is the praise we really covet and the blame we really dread. The little pockets of early Chrstians survived because they cared exclusively for the love of `the bretheren` and stopped their ears to the opinion of the Pagan society around them. But a circle of criminals, cranks, or perverts survives in just the same way; by becoming deaf to the opinion of the outer world, by discounting it as the chatter of outsiders who `don`t understand,` of the `conventional,` the `bourgeois,` the `Establishment,` of prigs, prudes, and humbugs. - C.S. Lewis': 0.5708532404742603, 'A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. - Oliver Wendell Holmes': 2.0393333747514353, 'Games lubricate the body and the mind. - Benjamin Franklin': 2.0393333747514353}\n",
